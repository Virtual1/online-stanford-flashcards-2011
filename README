*************************************************************************

=== Description
The aim of this project is to create a collaborative set of flashcards decks for the online Stanford classes.

We believe that the community effort combined with the technologies offered by nowadays automatic flashcards management softwares can produce a quasi-personalized review and exercises training program for each student.

This should result in a far higher long-term retention of the knowledge, a better recalling as well as a better induction (propagation of the intuition behind a concept).

=== Technical choices
We chose to use Anki as a the software framework for this project because Anki:
- is opensource
- supports all the major OSes (Windows, Linux, MacOSX)
- supports embedded medias (images, sounds, etc..)
- supports Latex equations
- has a desktop, web and mobile versions
- supports the sharing of the decks
- has an active development

Unfortunately, Anki does not yet supports the collaborative sharing of decks, so we chose to use a revision control system as the medium for the collaborative process, more specifically Git and Github, since we think appropriate to use the distributed "fork+push request" model and easy forking and merging facilities that Github offers us.

=== Publications
This project is based on the latest findings in the education and pedagogical field, more specifically:
- Spaced learning
- Test-enhanced learning
